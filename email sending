✅ Objective:
You want to send Outlook (Microsoft 365) emails using Java code, but cannot use passwords directly because:

MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) is enabled

App passwords are not allowed in your organization

So, you need to use OAuth2 authentication — the modern, secure way.

💡 What is OAuth2 (in simple terms)?
OAuth2 lets your app connect to Microsoft’s servers securely, without needing to store or send your password.

Your app uses a secret key (client secret) and app ID (client ID) to ask Microsoft:

“Can I act as this user and send an email?”

If Microsoft says “yes,” it gives your app a temporary access token.

🔧 Key Concepts You Need to Know
Term	What it means
Azure App Registration	A record in Azure saying “this is a trusted app”
Client ID	Like a username for your app
Client Secret	Like a password for your app
Tenant ID	ID for your company’s Microsoft 365 account
Access Token	A time-limited key to send requests (like sending mail)
Microsoft Graph API	The modern way to send mail via HTTP instead of SMTP

🔄 Step-by-Step Flow (Visual Breakdown)
1. Register Your App in Azure
You tell Microsoft:

“This is my Java app, it needs permission to send email.”

➡️ Microsoft gives you:

client_id

tenant_id

client_secret

2. Add Email Sending Permissions
You give your app permissions like:

Mail.Send

SMTP.Send (only if using SMTP)

➡️ Your Admin must approve these permissions.

3. Your App Requests an Access Token
Using HTTP, your app says:

“Hi Microsoft, I’m app client_id, here’s my secret. Please give me access to send mail.”

➡️ Microsoft responds with an access_token.

4. Your App Uses That Token to Send Email
Either via:

SMTP (like a mail server)

Graph API (like calling an API over HTTPS)

🟢 Recommended Method: Microsoft Graph API
Why?

Feature	Graph API	SMTP
Works with OAuth2	✅	✅ (but harder)
Works with client credentials (no user login)	✅	❌
Secure & Modern	✅	⚠️ Outdated
Easier to debug and scale	✅	❌

✅ Final Tech Stack Recommendation
Use Microsoft Graph API

Use client credentials flow for OAuth2

Use Java HTTP client to:

Get token

Send mail request

🎯 What You Need from IT/Admin
Register the app in Azure

Give you:

client_id

tenant_id

client_secret

Approve these permissions:

Mail.Send

offline_access

Allow Graph API access

🛠️ Once Setup Is Done, Your Java Code Will:
Call Microsoft to get access token.

Use that token to send a mail using a Graph API HTTP POST request.

✅ Next Step For You
Confirm: Do you want to send using Graph API (recommended)?

If yes, I’ll give you:

A ready-to-run Java example

A Postman collection (if you want to test before coding)

Curl script for token testing
